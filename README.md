    This is my labview utility code collection often using in my labview application.
It's high-efficiency and easy to use, also it'll save your valuable time.
Typically, my labview application folders is some kind like as below:
------branch
------tag
------trunk
     |--Resources
     |--SubVIs
        |-Utilities
        |-Others
     |--main.vi
     |-ProjectName.lvproj

    Note:Please open the VIs via Labview2013!
